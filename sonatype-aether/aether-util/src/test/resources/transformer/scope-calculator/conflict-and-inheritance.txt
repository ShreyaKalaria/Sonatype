# Another scenario to check that scope inheritance considers the effective scopes of parent nodes as determined during
# scope conflict resolution. In this example, gid:x:jar:1 should end up in compile scope (and not runtime) because its
# parent gid:c:jar:2 will be promoted to compile scope due to a conflict with gid:c:jar:1.

gid:root:jar:1
+- gid:a:jar:1:compile
|  \- gid:c:jar:2:runtime
|     \- gid:x:jar:1:compile
\- gid:b:jar:1:compile
   \- gid:c:jar:1:compile
